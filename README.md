The repository must have a README.md file that communicates the libraries used, the motivation for the project, the files in the repository with a small description of each, a summary of the results of the analysis, and necessary acknowledgements. Students should not use another student's code to complete the project, but they may use other references on the web including StackOverflow and Kaggle to complete the project.


# Titanic-Survival-Prediction-With-Logistic-Regression

The objective is to determine the survival chance of every passenger on board. First, we explore information  by applying exploratory  data analytics  on available  dataset and then apply a machine learning model to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. After this  the  results  of  applying  machine  learning  models  are compared and analyzed on the basis of accuracy.
